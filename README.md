# Product Management System
The aim is to store user data securely and provide services related to the stored information and maintain a secure environment without any breach of data.

There will be track of all the products that are imported and exported which will be provided with their own unique idâ€™s hence there wonâ€™t be any loss of information
or any miscalculations while providing the users their installment or settlements.

It is made simpler for tracking and keeping the records of the products which will be very useful for the industry which will help them in maintaining and doing their
respective operations in a keener and neater way which will reduce the burden of taking each and every responsibility for every single product with which the database
can manage them easily without any corruption of the data.

The system diagram for the proposed project is:

Saving time and fulfilling the users their requirement is our main criteria. Our aim is to remove the brockage charges and middle man in order to reduce the losses
faced by the manufacturer. 

Products which are managed will be directly supplied to their destinations without any delay and without any need of authentication of more signatures which will
avoid the complication in keeping track of the complete data for their further operations.
